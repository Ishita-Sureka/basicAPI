\# FastAPI Example Application

This is a simple FastAPI application that responds with a JSON object when accessed.

\## Features

\- \*\*Root Endpoint\*\*: Returns \`{"Hello": "World"}\` when a GET request is made to the root URL.

\## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.

\## Installation

1\. \*\*Clone the Repository\*\* (if applicable):

\`\`\`bash

git clone

cd

\`\`\`

2\. \*\*Install Dependencies\*\*:

Install FastAPI and Uvicorn using pip:

\`\`\`bash

pip install fastapi uvicorn

\`\`\`

\## Running the Application

1\. Save the code in a file named \`main.py\`:

\`\`\`python

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")

def read\_root():

return {"Hello": "World"}

\`\`\`

2\. Start the server with Uvicorn:

\`\`\`bash

uvicorn main:app --reload

\`\`\`

\- \`main\`: Refers to the Python file (without \`.py\`).

\- \`app\`: Refers to the FastAPI instance.

\- \`--reload\`: Enables auto-reload during development.

}
